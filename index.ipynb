Try to understand their business case:\n","\n","* If false positives are a bigger problem (labeled cottonwood/willow when it's really ponderosa pine), precision is the important metric to report\n","* If false negatives are a bigger problem (labeled ponderosa pine when it's really cottonwood/willow), recall is the important metric to report\n","\n","If those problems have truly equal importance, you could report an f1-score instead, although this is somewhat more difficult for the average person to interpret.\n","\n","#### BONUS: Adjusting the Decision Threshold\n","\n","If either of those problems is important enough that it outweighs overall accuracy, you could also adjust the decision threshold of your final model to improve the metric that matters most. Let's say that it's important to improve the recall score â€” that we want to be able to correctly label more of the cottonwood/willow trees as cottonwood/willow trees, even if that means accidentally labeling more ponderosa pine as cottonwood/willow incorrectly.\n","\n","Then we can use `.predict_proba` to err on the side of the positive class. Let's use an exaggerated example, which assumes that false negatives are a very significant problem. Instead of using the default 50% threshold (where a probability over 0.5 is classified as positive) let's say that if there is greater than a 1% chance it's positive, we classify it as positive:\n","\n","(If the opposite issue were the case â€” it's very important that every area classified as 1 is actually cottonwood/willow â€” you would want the threshold to be higher than 50% rather than lower than 50%.)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":43,"metadata":{},"outputs":[{"data":{"text/plain":["0    0.586433\n","1    0.413567\n","dtype: float64"]},"execution_count":43,"metadata":{},"output_type":"execute_result"}],"source":["# Run this cell without changes\n","\n","def final_model_func(model, X):\n","    \"\"\"\n","    Custom function to predict probability of\n","    cottonwood/willow.
